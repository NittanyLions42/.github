## Hi there 👋

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Wellness Buddy App! This ReadMe document will provide you with an overview of the purpose, scope, and necessary resources for this project.

## Purpose
The Wellness Buddy App is designed to help students at Pennsylvania State University and users everywhere make healthy lifestyle choices, particularly when it comes to dealing with stress and maintaining physical health.
